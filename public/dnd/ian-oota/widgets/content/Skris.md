# Skris

  - Owns magic shop in the royal quarter of Gracklstugh. (Curious and Collectables from Beyond the Caverns)
  - Expert on combat & military history
  - Lizardfolk

The colored crystals used during the summoning ritual in Sloobludop were most likely Sapphires.

There are likely breaks in the Demonweb Pits. This would need to be the case in order for the Demon Princes to escape into the underdark so easily. If the Demonweb Pits are broken, there is likely an issue with Lolth, for she is fated to maintain the webs.
  - Summoning Lolth (as Illvara was attempting to do) would prevent her from maintaining the Pits.
  - Lolth & Beshaba assisted w/ the escapse of demon princes in the past.
  - If Illvara/high priests are traitors, Lolth loses much of her power.
  - Velkenvelve = proving ground for young drow elites. Fairly safe outpost, generally.
  - Illvara is NOT the high priestess of Menzoberranzan, but is close. (It is likely that if she captured us, she would receive the promotion.)
  - Previous high priest (archmage) vanished from his tower in Menzoberranzan roughly 1-2 years ago. There is no current High Priest(ess).

Spider King (Below Gracklstugh):
  - Was the result of one of Bupedo's experiments with regeneration magics.

___
### Stella's Signet Ring
  - Insignia of House Forgeborn.
    - Important family in Gauntylgrym (surface town. Has a (Sealed) entrance to the underdark there).
    - Mostly metalworkers & weaponsmiths.

### Skris's take on the current politics:
  - Stoneguard inept due to leadership
  - Fembershaad will likely try to take control if freed.
  - Deep King was previously a good ruler (before the influence of Cassandra) (Although some still wouldn't like him)
  - Hard to say if Fembershaad would be good for city if he ruled. (Random as far as we know, currently.)

## Tomes
Faerzress
- is NOT a moss. It is an energy. Can take form of moss, but can also just be magical energy.
- Useful for divination/scrying
- Changes based on area
    - Reacts to the demeanor/actions of the population around it
    - Lots of corruption = bad
    - Feedback loop of madness?
- Likely going cause roll on magic table to utilize in strange ways.
- NOT native to the underdark. Started appearing after the disappearance of Beshaba.

## History
Before Demonweb Pits:
  - Beshaba & Lolth (sisters) guarded the exit to the Abyss.
  - They started to sympathize with the Demon Lords
  - Betrayed the gods by allowing the Demon Princes to escapse w/o giving warning, or attempting to stop them.
  - Beshaba then dissappeared. Has not been seen since, as far as Skris is aware.

Library of Gravenhollow:
  - Can only be found when it wants you to find it.
  - Complete encyclopedia of the world (no information must be lost, type thing) (Potentially utilize this to gain entry!? If something would be lost forever if we did not intervene?)
  - Origins of the library are unknown.
  - Last person to enter & return that Skris is aware of was Brysis Kaim.
  - Sunspear is artifact related to Brysis. "If you can bring it back to her home city, they can unlock its properties." (Netheril  - fallen civilication of half-elves. Used to make flying cities."
  - Spirit we fought in Brysis tomb was dressed as Brysis, but we could see nothing but its clothing.
    - She could have been pretending to be fighting?? (if it were actually the unadultered spirit of Brysis, we'd likely be dead)
    - When in the tomb (& possessed by the spirit?), Donnar heard the same voice as the one that repeated "Demagorgon" to him.

## Geography of the Underdark

Best bet to escape the Underdark:
  - Blingdenstone

Alternatives:
  - Wyrm ridings of Menzoberranzan: contains an outlet to the surface
  - Deeper into underdark: could potentially encounter a portal to the surface world.
  - Gauntylgrym passage. Is sealed from the surface side.
